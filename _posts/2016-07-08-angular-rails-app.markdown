**Integrating Angular With Rails**
Angular and Rails aren't really designed to work together, so building an application integrating both together requires some finagling.

-Rails gems
-Bower to manage front end dependencies

**Rails Back End**
-Models, controllers - no real views since that will be handled by Angular
-Devise - use Angular Devise dependency through Bower

**Angular Front End**
