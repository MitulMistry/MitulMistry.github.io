Earlier in my education when I was coding in `C++`, I was using `Subversion` for version control (specifically [TortoiseSVN][tortoise-svn]). `SVN` worked well enough, and in class we were able to share code for the different projects we were working on effectively. But since then, for better or worse, the world has moved on to `Git`. You can read about the differences on countless websites, like [here][git-vs-svn], so I won't get into it.

For most of my efforts learning web development, I've been using `Github`. It's the go-to destination for uploading, revisioning, and sharing code. A `remote` on `Github` is just a repository stored on their servers. You code locally on your machine - or your cloud IDE - and push code from your local repo to your `remote`. Because I've been coding in multiple development environments, this has made keeping code consistent relatively easy.

Earlier when I was using SVN, I didn't create multiple branches to develop different feature sets without breaking the master, something I try to do now when using `Git`. I've come to find that both systems offer great functionality, but your own practices for managing your code will ultimately make the most difference.

You can take a look at my repos [here on Github.][github]
