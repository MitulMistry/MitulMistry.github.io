  <article class="post-content">
    <p>After learning the basics of Ruby and ORMs, I’ve been working on a project leveraging the Sinatra development framework. Along with Activerecord, I’ve used it to build a simple blogging application and I will describe the process of developing it here.</p>

<p>The project uses basic Model View Controller architecture. It has a few simple models that interact with various routes in the controller which then composes and serves the different blog pages through the views.</p>

<p><strong>Models:</strong></p>

<p>The first thing I worked on were the models that would represent the data necessary for the blog to work using Activerecord. This includes <code>Users</code> which would write and edit <code>Posts</code>, which would in turn have <code>Tags</code>. In addition, I used the model <code>PostTags</code> as well, but only as an intermediary for a join table to connect <code>Posts</code> and <code>Tags</code>. This was necessary because a <code>Post</code> has many <code>Tags</code>, and a <code>Tag</code> has many <code>Posts</code>, and any time there’s a mutual ‘has many’ relationship between models, a join table is needed.</p>

<p>These associations provide a useful way to list different types of <code>Posts</code>. All <code>Posts</code> belong to a <code>User</code>, so you can easily list all of a <code>User</code>’s <code>Posts</code>, or all of a <code>Tag</code>’s <code>Posts</code> as well. Providing an easy way to organize information is critical to building a successful application, and ActiveRecord provides ample ways of doing just that.</p>

<p><em>The <code>Post</code> model code:</em></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:user</span>
  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:post_tags</span>
  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:tags</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">through</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:post_tags</span>

  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">FindBySlug</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">slug</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">downcase</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gsub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;-&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">readable_date</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">created_at</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;%b %d, %Y&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Controllers:</strong></p>

<p>Unlike a framework like Rails, Sinatra has a unified router and controller. I used a separate controller for each model which helped organize all the different routes and actions. The <code>Users</code> controller focuses on signing up and logging in <code>Users</code>. The <code>Posts</code> controller deals with the majority of the application’s functionality, namely the creation, editting, and deletion of <code>Posts</code> as well as <code>Tags</code> (since <code>Tags</code> are created in the same page as <code>Posts</code>). Finally, the <code>Tags</code> and application  controllers focus on a few utility tasks. As a whole, the controllers work together to facilitate the functionality of the website and process all the data.</p>

<p><em>An route/action to render the new post creation form:</em></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/posts/new&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">logged_in?</span>
    <span class="vi">@tags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Tag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span>
    <span class="n">erb</span> <span class="ss">:&#39;posts/new&#39;</span>
  <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="n">redirect</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/users/login&#39;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Views:</strong></p>

<p>Just like Rails, Sinatra uses <code>ERB</code> files (Embedded Ruby) to dynamically generate html web pages and serve requested content. The views correspond to the routes/actions in the associated controllers, so there are views for showing a user page, displaying a login form, and so on. Using Bootstrap for basic frontend styling helps make the application look at least palatable (as opposed to hideous unstyled html). It may be a bit superficial, but it helps the application look like a complete thought.</p>

<p><em>The ERB code to display all the posts for a tag:</em></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= @tag.name %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="err">&lt;</span>% @tag.posts.each do |post| %&gt;
  <span class="nt">&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;/posts/&lt;%= post.slug %&gt;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= post.title %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;h4&gt;</span>By: <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;/users/&lt;%= post.user.slug %&gt;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= post.user.username %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= post.readable_date %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= post.content %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="err">&lt;</span>% end %&gt;</code></pre></div>

<p>In conclusion, the project took longer than I expected due to the necessary refactoring to deal with things like processing the form data during post creation and editting as well all the individual gears necessary for even a simple web project like this involving a back end. It was certainly an educational experience and a good step towards learning to build professional grade applications.</p>
